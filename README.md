# ESP8266 Relay (Part 2) plus Sonoff (with Alexa)
New code for the ESP8266-01 and a new phone app to control it all - plus first look at the 4-channel Sonoff using Alexa

So let's finish up on the "improvements" I've made to the ESP8266-01 relay module. I've rewritten the code for the ESP-01 and generated a new app for my phone, with a simple ON/OFF function. Basically, I've turned this unit into something similar to a single channel Sonoff!

However, it still required more work (and a hack, er, hardware reconfiguration) to do all this and we really should not have to do any of this. I discovered a simpler relay module that also takes an ESP-01 and seemed to be the answer. Was it? Watch the video and find out.

We also explore the new 4-channel Sonoff Pro that I link into my Amazon Echo (Alexa) with no fuss at all. I'm impressed with this unit. It does what I expected it to do (after setting some DIP switch options) and will definitely form part of my workshop automation project. Nice one, Sonoff!

So after this all this I'm thinking of my Raspberry Pi-based (Model B3+) hub running MQTT (mosquito) and Node Red - see what I'm talking about and then please give me suggestions, ideas and examples of what you have done.

This will require you to login or register but it is well worth doing so.  
If you already use Node Red or other browser-based flow editor this will be easy to use.
